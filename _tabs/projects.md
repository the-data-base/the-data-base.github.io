We like to work on projects together. Each project differs in scale and scope, however the intention is to build an eco-system of clean & documented data that can be used to practice and apply data science.

Below are some projects:

## 1. nhl
* **what**: modernizing hockey analytics with public NHL data
* **where**: github organization for [the-data-base](https://github.com/orgs/the-data-base/repositories)
* **documentation**: [nhl-project](../posts/nhl-stats-api)

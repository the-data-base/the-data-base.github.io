## 👋 Hello!

Welcome to the official website for `the-data-base`. The site exists to share learnings, and centralize documentation for projects that are either in progress or completed.

## 👨‍💻 Who we are 👩‍💻

We are a community of data professionals who have come together to deepen our career journeys in **DATA**.

We believe that the best way to learn is by ~~trying~~ **DOING**, and that learning can be enriched within a **COMMUNITY**.

## 🌐 The community

We exist on Slack, and are working on making this channel accessible to join. For now, feel free to send a Twitter DM to the admins:
